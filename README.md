## Welcome to PELE-TWO
<div align="justify">
  <p>
   This website stands as a documentary ressource for all those who proceed a degree in either electrical installation or electrical planification. Ideally destinated to those   who follows a swiss formation that leads to a Certificat Federal of capacity. But probably also usefull to a lot of other people out there on this planet.
  </p>
  <p>
   This website is edited with the Github page editor. It is divided in several chapters, each one of these corresponding to a topic within the electrical planification formation.
  </p>
  <p>
The goal of this page isn't to provide a full and structurated course on electrical technics and will never replace a proper lesson given by a talented and trained teacher. The purpose here is more to aggregate and make a bit of order in the vast amount of videos, files and links that my classmates and I shared on our WA class group. From now, what at the end would have been lost into the infinity of the WA thread in a what we could call a "black hole" style gestion of documentation (Anything that enters in it can never goes out again) will now at least be a bit more organized.
  </p>
  <p>
Often really interesting though also most of the time totally useless in an academic perspective, all those files are clearly meant either to entertain yourself or to satisfy your curiosity in a way a good teacher would never succeed to do (Except maybe M. OM of B, who's clearly as brilliant as entertaining but also as messy as our WA thread).
